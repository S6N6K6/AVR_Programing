## 1. Scope of this repository

    With this repository I try to get a hands on experience in working with 
    Embedded C on the AVR platform, mainly on the ATmega328p microcontroller.
    The projects covered in this repository are of the basic type such as:
    ////////REGISTER CONTROL WITH BIT BANGING////////
    
        * *blinking an LED*
        * *blinking a series of LED's*
        * *accesing the ADC registers to measure analog values*
        * *timer control*
        * *interrupts*
        
    ////////INTERFACING////////
        * *LCD interface*
        * *Driver for LCD Screen*
        * *UART Comunication*
        * *I2C Comunication*
        * *SPI Comunication*
        * *PWM Control*
        * *DC Motor driver*
        * *Servomotors interfacing*
        * *Stepper Motors*
## 2. Microcontroller Used
    For this project I shall use an ATmega328p as it is easy to program and get a hand on it.
    Having multiple uC's allows for learning the communication protocols between them
    For a better understanding I will add an image showing the pinout of the uC.
